# Zeitplan, an [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) widget

Always keep an eye on the passing time and view the events of a specific calendar in an unobtrusive, yet always visible way.

Especially if you tend to procrastinate or regularly loose track of the important projects, this works wonders.

You can define your own calendar name in the main.js file. By default a calendar called "Zeitplan" will be used.
