# ZeitPlan ([Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) widget)

Always keep an eye on the passing time and view the events of a specific calendar in an unobtrusive, yet always visible way.

Especially if you tend to procrastinate or regularly loose track of the important projects, this works wonders.
